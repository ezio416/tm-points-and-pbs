# Points and PBs

When playing in a server (or solo if you really want to), this will show a window containing the points (if applicable, i.e. ranked mode) and personal best times of everyone in the lobby.

Forked from [XertroV's "List Players' PBs' plugin](https://github.com/XertroV/tm-list-players-pbs)
